**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Connect â†’ token saved to database encrypted

## Issue 2: Gmail sync & APIs

**Title:** Build Gmail API service for message fetching and synchronization

**Description:**
Implement Gmail API integration to fetch, parse, and store email messages with pagination support.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] `POST /inbox/gmail/sync?limit=50` fetches last N messages from Gmail

- [ ] Store Gmail labels (`INBOX`, `UNREAD`, `IMPORTANT`, etc.)
- [ ] Extract both plain text and HTML content from messages
- [ ] Handle multi-part MIME messages properly

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `google-api-python-client` for Gmail API
- Store messages in `emails` table with proper indexing
- Parse base64-encoded message content
- Handle rate limiting with exponential backoff
- Support both individual messages and batch operations

**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Idempotent sync (re-running doesn't create duplicates)
- [ ] Pagination cursors work correctly
- [ ] Labels persisted accurately
- [ ] Large HTML emails handled without crashes
- [ ] Rate limiting gracefully handled

- Follow existing Tailwind CSS design system

**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Filtered views show correct message counts
- [ ] Empty states display helpful messages
- [ ] UI responsive on mobile devices
- [ ] Loading states appear during data fetching
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully

## Issue 4: AI drafts & audit

**Title:** Implement AI-powered draft generation with approval workflow

**Description:**
Build AI draft generation system with human approval workflow and comprehensive audit logging.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] AI drafts include rationale and confidence score
- [ ] Store all drafts to `message_audit` table with metadata
- [ ] UI "Generate draft" button with loading state
- [ ] Draft appears within 6 seconds
- [ ] Copy button to copy draft to clipboard

- [ ] Include order context when messages are linked
- [ ] Support editing drafts before approval
- [ ] Track generation latency and model used

**Implementation Notes:**
- Integrate with existing LLM provider configuration
- Use conversation context and order history for personalization
- Implement proper error handling for API failures
- Add rate limiting for AI generation calls
- Store user satisfaction feedback when provided

**Test Plan:**
- [ ] Draft generated within 6s with rationale
- [ ] Audit row logged for each generation
- [ ] Copy functionality works reliably
- [ ] Order context improves draft quality

## Issue 5: Order link detection

**Title:** Build automatic order number detection and linking system

**Description:**
Implement regex-based system to automatically detect Etsy order numbers and URLs in email content and link them to existing orders.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Regex patterns detect order numbers: `order #(\d{10,})`, `receipt #(\d{10,})`
- [ ] Detect Etsy transaction URLs: `etsy.com/your/shops/[^/]+/transactions/(\d+)`

- Store regex patterns in configuration for easy updates
- Consider fuzzy matching for slight variations
- Validate order numbers exist in Etsy data when possible

**Test Plan:**
